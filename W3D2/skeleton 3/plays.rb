# Let's add the following methods to our ORM:
#
# Play::find_by_title(title)
# Play::find_by_playwright(name) (returns all plays written by playwright)
# In addition, create a Playwright class and add the following methods to our ORM.
#
# Playwright::all
# Playwright::find_by_name(name)
# Playwright#new (this is the initialize method)
# Playwright#create
# Playwright#update
# Playwright#get_plays (returns all plays written by playwright)
# Remember, our PlayDBConnection class accesses the database stored in plays.db, which includes both the plays and playwrights tables.
